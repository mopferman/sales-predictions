Predicting the sales of various items

# overview
The purpose of this project is to predict sales for food items sold at various stores. The overall goal is to help the retailer understand why and how the products play a huge role in deciding what increases sales.

Through cleaning the data and building visualizations, stakeholders will be able to grasp a better understanding of what the data is portraying. This then will provide insights and recommendations for the corporation. 

# explanation of the data
Throughout this project, many visualizations were made in order to show the data in different ways. They are represented through bar charts, boxplots, histograms, etc. These types of visualizations help stakeholders better anaylze how and what is happening within an organization. For example, in the bar chart made, fruits and vegetables are the most popular item type and seafood is the least popular item type. The boxplot also shows that starchy foods have the highest average item weight whereas breakfast the the lowest average item weight. 

We analyzed many data points, and the most important category that was focused on was the Item_Outlet_Sales. This metric is very useful in determining and predicting the sales for the organization. A useful way of prediction is through machine learning. Simple regression, linear regression, and decision trees (bagged v random forest) are good tools in order to predict a metric, in this project's case, sales. Through running these models, I have come to realization that linear regression makes the best predictive model for this project. Through finding the RMSE (the root of mean squared error) we were able to determine why it worked the best.

# recommendations
I would recommend to the organization that they should increase their sales by increasing the MRP of baking goods and health & hygiene products inorder to keep up with the rest of the other MRPs. This would then increase the organizations sales gradually.
